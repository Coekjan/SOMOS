**SOMOS** is based on **BUAA-MOS**, and the author **[@Coekjan](https://github.com/Coekjan)** has passed the excellent defense of MOS-Lab.

## Acknowledgement

The code refers to the following repositories:
* **Login256**: [BUAA-OS-2019](https://github.com/login256/BUAA-OS-2019)
* **refkxh**: [BUAA_OS_2020Spring](https://github.com/refkxh/BUAA_OS_2020Spring)

Without their help, @Coekjan could hardly have completed the entire MOS-Lab.

## Future

Post some **Key Content Analysis** on [my blog](https://coekjan.cn/)...
